Australia Climate Data Guide Catalogue          *A one-stop catalogue to discover Climate Data in Australia*         The ACDG portal is a metadata portal listing climate research resources available in Australia from multiple data repositories.         This is a community based project managed by the ACDG Single Access working group. This is a group of Australian climate community self-nominated representatives. Anyone is welcome to join the group or to contribute independently to the metadata portal the group is developing.          Australian Ocean Data Network          The Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN) is an interoperable online network of marine and climate data resources.  IMOS and the 6 Australian Commonwealth agencies ([see AODN Partners](https://imos.org.au/facilities/aodn/aodn-data-management/aodn-partners)) form the core of the AODN. Increasingly, though, universities and State government offices are offering up data resources to the AODN, and delivery of data to the AODN is being written in to significant research programs e.g. [National Environmental Science Program Marine Biodiversity Hub](http://www.nespmarine.edu.au/) and the [Great Australian Bight research program](http://www.misa.net.au/GAB).

FLUXNET          FLUXNET is an international \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d tying together regional networks of earth system scientists. FLUXNET scientists use the eddy covariance technique to measure the cycling of carbon, water, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. Scientists use these data to better understand ecosystem functioning, and to detect trends in climate, greenhouse gases, and air pollution.          CEDA Archive          The CEDA Archive forms part of NERC's Environmental Data Service (EDS) and is responsible for looking after data from atmospheric and earth observation research. They host over 18 Petabytes of data from climate models, satellites, aircraft, met observations, and other sources.          OZFlux          OzFlux is an ecosystem research network set up to provide Australian, New Zealand and global ecosystem modelling communities with consistent observations of energy, carbon and water exchange between the atmosphere and key Australian and New Zealand ecosystems.          Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection          This collection is a collaborative effort between the Australian Climate Service (ACS), ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes (CLEX) and the wider Australian climate research community to re-establish and maintain a reference dataset collection at NCI.

First, the script looks for model results in the directory you specified in the <code>--model_root</code> option. It will treat each subdirectory of the specified directory as a separate model result. Here since we only have one such directory, <code>CLM40cn</code>, it found that and set it up as a model in the system. Next it parsed the configure file we examined earlier. We see that it found the CERES data source for both variables as we specified it. If the source data was not found or some other problem was encountered, the green <code>Initialized</code> will appear as red text which explains what the problem was (most likely <code>MisplacedData</code>). If you encounter this error, make sure that <code>ILAMB_ROOT</code> is set correctly and that the data really is in the paths you specified in the configure file.</p> <p>Next we ran all model-confrontation pairs. In our parlance, a confrontation is a benchmark observational dataset and its accompanying analsys. We have two confrontations specified in our configure file and one model, so we have two entries here. If the analysis completed without error, you will see a green <code>Completed</code> text appear along with the runtime. Here we see that <code>albedo</code> took a few seconds longer than <code>rsus</code>, presumably because we had the additional burden of reading in two datasets and combining them.</p> <p>The next stage is the post-processing. This is done as a separate loop to exploit some parallelism. All the work in a model-confrontation pair is purely local to the pair. Yet plotting results on the same scale implies that we know the maxmimum and minimum values from all models and thus requires the communcation of this information. Here, as we are plotting only over the globe and not extra regions, the plotting occurs quickly.</p>"},{"location":"model_evaluation/model_evaluation_on_gadi/model_evaluation_on_gadi_ilamb/#42-run-specific-models-and-regions","title":"4.2) Run specific models and regions","text":"<p>As mentioned in Section 3.3, you can adjust the models and regions that <code>ilamb</code> will run on.
