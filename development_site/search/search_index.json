If, for example, we want to run the suite for a total of 50 Years, and resubmit every year, we will change Total Run length to <code>P50Y</code> and Cycling frequency to <code>P1Y</code>. Note that the current maximum Cycling frequency is 2 years:                  </li> <li>                 Wallclock time                                  The Wallclock time is the time requested by the PBS job to run a single cycle. If this time is not enough for the suite to end its cycle, our job will be terminated before the suite can complete the run.                                   If we change the Cycling frequency, we might need to change the Wallclock time accordingly.                                   The time needed for the suite to run a full cycle depends on several factors, but a good estimation can be 4 hours per simulated year.                                  To modify the Wallclock time, we can navigate to suite conf --&gt; Run Initialisation and Cycling, edit the respective field, and click the Save button . The value is in the ISO 8601 Duration format.             </li> </ul> </li> </ol> For more details on how to edit other suite parameters using Rose GUI, such as component configurations, output variables (STASH), or science settings, check Rose GUI user guide."},{"location":"models/running-a-model/running-access-cm/#run-an-access-cm2-suite","title":"Run an ACCESS-CM2 suite","text":"After completing all the modifications to the suite, we are ready to run it.  ACCESS-CM2 suites run on Gadi(TO DO check link) through a PBS job submission.  When the suite gets run, the suite configuration files are copied on Gadi under <code>/scratch/[Project]/$USER/cylc-run/[suite-ID]</code>, and a symbolic link to this folder is also created in the <code>$USER</code>'s home directory under <code>~/cylc-run/[suite-ID]</code>.  An ACCESS-CM2 suite is constituted by several tasks (such as checking out code repositories, compiling and building the different model components, running the model, etc.). The workflow of these tasks is controlled by Cylc.  Cylc (pronounced \u2018silk\u2019), is a workflow manager that automatically executes tasks according to the model main cycle script <code>suite.rc</code>. Cylc deals with how the job will be run and the time steps of each sub-model, as well as monitoring all the tasks and reporting any error that might occur.  To run an ACCESS-CM2 suite, on accessdev: <ol> <li>         Run <code>rose suite-run</code> from inside the relevant suite directory (e.g. <code>~/roses/u-[suite_ID]</code>) to run the initial tasks.     </li> <li>         After these few small tasks get executed, the Cylc GUI will open up and you will be able to see and control all the different tasks in the suite as they are run.     </li> </ol> You are done! If you don't get any errors, you will be able to check the suite output files after the run is complete.  Note that, at this stage, it is possible to close the Cylc GUI. If you want to open it again, just run: <code>gcylc .....
