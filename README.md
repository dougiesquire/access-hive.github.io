# How to Contribute to ACCESS-Hive
- Create a branch from the `main` branch of ACCESS-HIVE repo, for instance, `dev/jasmeen/legacy-release`. Use the following two commands to create a new branch and push it to github respectively:

    `git checkout -b dev/jasmeen/legacy-release`

    `git push --set-upstream origin dev/jasmeen/legacy-release`

- Prefixing the branch name with `dev/jasmeen` might be used as an indicator that this needs to merged in the `development` branch of access-hive (staging branch deployed on https://access-hive.org.au/development_site/), and _**not**_ the main branch.

- Work locally on the branch `dev/jasmeen/legacy-release`, and push the commits using the commands: 

    `git add .`

    `git commit -m "First commit"`

    `git push`

- On github, create a pull request and making sure to change the `base` to `development`. (Please find the below screenshot). This would create a pr on the `development` branch.
