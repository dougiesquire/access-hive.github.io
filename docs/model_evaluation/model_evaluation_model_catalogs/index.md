# ACCESS-NRI intake Model Catalog

The ACCESS-NRI intake catalog aims to provide a way for Python users to discover and load data across a broad range of climate data products available on the Australian NCI supercomputer Gadi. For detailed information, tutorials and more, please go to the

## What is the ACCESS-NRI intake Model Catalog?

The ACCESS-NRI catalog is essentially a table of climate data products that exist on Gadi. Each entry in the table corresponds to a different product, and the columns contain attributes associated with each productâ€“things like the models, frequencies and variables available. Users can search on the attributes to find the products that might be useful to them. For example, a user might want to know which data products contain variables X, Y and Z at monthly frequency. The ACCESS-NRI catalog enables users to find products that satisfy their query and to subsequently load their data without having to know the location and structure of the underlying files.

## Showcase: use intake to easily find, load and plot data

In this showcase, we'll demonstrate one of the simplest use-cases of the ACCESS-NRI intake catalog: a user wants to plot a timeseries of a variable from a specific data product. Here, the variable is a scalar ocean variable called "temp_global_ave" and the product is an ACCESS-OM2 run called "025deg_jra55_iaf_omip2_cycle1".

First we load the catalog using

```python
import intake
catalog = intake.cat.access_nri
```

Now we can load and plot available datasets of the variable "temp_global_ave" from the product "025deg_jra55_iaf_omip2_cycle1" using

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dataset_dict = catalog["025deg_jra55_iaf_omip2_cycle1"].search(
    variable="temp_global_ave"
).to_dataset_dict()

# `dataset_dict` contains two xarray Datasets, one at daily frequency and one at monthly
dataset_dict["ocean_scalar_snapshot.1day"]["temp_global_ave"].plot(label="daily")
dataset_dict["ocean_scalar.1mon"]["temp_global_ave"].plot(label="monthly")
plt.title("")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
```
