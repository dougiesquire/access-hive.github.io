# Observational Data Catalog

We are working in cooperation with NCI to currate observational data collections for you that are being hosted by NCI. ACCESS-NRI and NCI are actively currating the data collections and we are working on including new data collections.

You can search the available data collections on the NCI Data Collections website:

<!-- In particular, we want to highlight the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 6 and 5 that are hosted by NCI as a sponsor of the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.nci.org.au/projects/esgf-nci/). The ESGF are federated data centres across the globe that enable access to the largest archive of climate data world-wide. This portal allows you to find, select and download data files from the federation. -->
