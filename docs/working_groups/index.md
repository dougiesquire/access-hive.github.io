# Community Working Groups

The ACCESS Community and the ACCESS-NRI has recently established [community Working Groups](https://www.access-nri.org.au/working-groups/) to assess and prioritise the needs of the modelling community as well as encourage collaboration within. These Working Groups, which are open to the public and welcoming new members, include:

- [Atmosphere](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/atmosphere/7)
- [Land Surface](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/land/8)
- [COSIMA: Ocean and Sea-Ice](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cosima/29) 
- [Forecasting and Prediction](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/forecasting-and-prediction/36)
- [Earth System](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/esm/35) 
- [Cryosphere](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cryosphere/34)
